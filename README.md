aiohttp-request-id-logging
==========================

When you log from your web application, usually log messages from different requests are intertwined and you cannot surely tell which line was generated by what request. For example:

```
2020-01-15 15:35:37,501  INFO: Processing money transfer id 1234
2020-01-15 15:35:37,976  INFO: Processing money transfer id 5678
2020-01-15 15:35:38,201 ERROR: Oh no, something bad has hapenned! Cannot finish the transfer.
2020-01-15 15:35:38,504  INFO: 127.0.0.1 [15/Jan/2020:14:35:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 165 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
2020-01-15 15:35:38,982  INFO: 127.0.0.1 [15/Jan/2020:14:35:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 165 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

So, which transfer has failed? The one with id 1234, or the one with id 5678?

This library helps you to solve this in a few steps:

1. **`request_id_middleware()`:** Generate random `request_id` for each aiohttp request and

   - store it in a ContextVar `aiohttp_request_id_logging.request_id`
   - store it also in `request['request_id']`

2. **`setup_logging_request_id_prefix()`:** Modify logging record factory so that the request_id is attached to every logging record created

   - so you should modify your log format, for example `logging.basicConfig(format=... %(levelname)5s: %(requestIdPrefix)s%(message)s')`

3. Because the aiohttp access logging happens out of the middleware scope, the request id ContextVar would be already resetted. So **`RequestIdContextAccessLogger`** is provided that adds the request_id to the access log message.

4. If you use Sentry, a `request_id` tag is added when the request is processed.

This is how the result looks like:

```
2020-01-15 15:58:47,238  INFO: [O5bvIlU] Processing GET / (__main__:hello)
2020-01-15 15:58:47,950  INFO: [xtMacpA] Processing GET / (__main__:hello)
2020-01-15 15:58:48,240  INFO: [O5bvIlU] Processing money transfer id 1234
2020-01-15 15:58:48,953  INFO: [xtMacpA] Processing money transfer id 5678
2020-01-15 15:58:49,182 ERROR: [xtMacpA] Oh no, something bad has hapenned! Cannot finish the transfer.
2020-01-15 15:58:49,242  INFO: [O5bvIlU] 127.0.0.1 "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 165 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
2020-01-15 15:58:49,959  INFO: [xtMacpA] 127.0.0.1 "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 165 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

Example
-------

```python
from aiohttp import web
from aiohttp.web_log import AccessLogger
from aiohttp_request_id_logging import (
    setup_logging_request_id_prefix,
    request_id_middleware,
    RequestIdContextAccessLogger)

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world!\n")

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s [%(threadName)s] %(name)-26s %(levelname)5s: %(requestIdPrefix)s%(message)s')

setup_logging_request_id_prefix()

app = web.Application(middlewares=[request_id_middleware()])
app.add_routes([web.get('/', hello)])

web.run_app(app, access_log_class=RequestIdContextAccessLogger)
```
